# File Format

Snowflake File format is a named database object that can be used to simplify the process of accessing the staged data and Streamlines loading data into and unloading data out of database tables.

**CSV** (Comma-Separated Values): A structured format commonly used for tabular data.

**JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation): A semi-structured format that represents data as key-value pairs.

**AVRO**: A compact binary format that supports schema evolution.

**ORC** (Optimized Row Columnar): A columnar storage format optimized for performance.

**PARQUET**: Another columnar storage format that balances compression and query performance.

**XML**: A format for representing hierarchical data.

```SQL
create file format garden_plants.veggies.PIPECOLSEP_ONEHEADROW 
    TYPE = 'CSV'--csv is used for any flat file (tsv, pipe-separated, etc)
    FIELD_DELIMITER = '|' --pipes as column separators
    SKIP_HEADER = 1 --one header row to skip
    ;

create file format garden_plants.veggies.COMMASEP_DBLQUOT_ONEHEADROW 
    TYPE = 'CSV'--csv for comma separated files
    SKIP_HEADER = 1 --one header row  
    FIELD_OPTIONALLY_ENCLOSED_BY = '"' --this means that some values will be wrapped in double-quotes bc they have commas in them
    ;
```

# Stages
**Snowflake stages** are named storage locations in Snowflake where you can temporarily load or unload data files before transferring them to Snowflake tables. Think of a Snowflake stage as a pointer or reference to a data file or set of data files. Here are some key points about Snowflake stages:

1. **Internal Stages**:
   - Internal stages store data files **internally within Snowflake**. They can be either permanent or temporary.
   - These stages are useful for loading data from local files into Snowflake tables.
   - You can create an internal stage using the `CREATE STAGE` command.
   - Directory tables can be associated with internal stages to catalog staged files in cloud storage.
   - Types:
        - User Stage
        - Table Stage
        - Named Stage

2. **External Stages**:
   - External stages reference data files stored **outside of Snowflake**.
   - Supported cloud storage services for external stages include:
     - Amazon S3 buckets
     - Google Cloud Storage buckets
     - Microsoft Azure containers
   - The storage location can be private/protected or public.
   - You cannot access data held in archival cloud storage classes that require restoration before retrieval.
   - Similar to internal stages, you can create an external stage using the `CREATE STAGE` command.

Remember that Snowflake stages play a crucial role in efficiently moving data between different storage locations and Snowflake tables! üòäüîç
